Here is my own layer to enable dart-mode, by integrating language protocol for
dart language.
With the following dart layer for dart-mode, etc., my own dart support layer
might be redundant or duplicate.

Note, there is a layer called dart at the following:
"/home/yshen/.emacs.d/layers/+lang/dart/"

this layer should not be called dart, but dart-language-protocol-integration or
something different to dart and show the intent.

Some of the ob-dart configuration might be placed in the layer yubrshen of my
own customization, as post-init (maybe)
